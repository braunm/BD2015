The BD2015 package complements the article:

Bayesian Hierarchical Models.  Marketing Science.  Articles in
Advance. DOI:  10.1287/mksc.2014.0901

The bayesGDS package is the most up-to-date source of code for the BD
algorithm, and is actively improved and maintained.  That package
provides additional documentation, vignettes and examples.  This
package (BD2015) is no longer supported or maintained, but was provided
at the request of the journal.

Again, if you want to learn more about about to implement the BD
algorithm, you should refer to the bayesGDS package, and the
associated documentation, vignettes and examples.

See the LICENSE, DESCRIPTION and COPYRIGHTS files more information about usage
permissions and copyright ownership.

Installation:

The models in the BD2015 package were written in C++, using the CppAD
automatic differentiation library.  CppAD is not available as an R
package, so it needs to be downloaded and installed separately.
Another requirement is the CppADutils R package.  CppADutils is not
available on CRAN, but it can be downloaded and installed from
www.github.com/braunm.

CppADutils assumes that CppAD is installed in the /opt/cppad
directory.  If CppAD is installed in another directory, the
src/Makevars files in CppADutils will have to be changed before
installing it.

Other dependencies are listed in the DESCRIPTION file.
