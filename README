This package (BD2015) is no longer supported or maintained. Readers who are interested in using the BD algorithm in the referenced paper should refer to the bayesGDS package, which is hosted at http://cran.r-project.org/package=bayesGDS. The bayesGDS package is the most up-to-date source of code for the BD algorithm, and is actively improved and maintained.  That package provides additional documentation, vignettes and examples.

Readers should also refer to the sparseHessianFD, sparseMVN and trustOptim packages, which are also hosted at cran.r-project.org.  These packages are dependencies of BD2015.


The following files run the BD algorithm for the examples in the
paper.  All files can be found in the examples directory.

conjugate.R
cheese.R
scale.R

Installation:

The models in the BD2015 package were written in C++, using the CppAD
automatic differentiation library.  CppAD is not available as an R
package, so it needs to be downloaded and installed separately. It is available at http://www.coin-or.org/CppAD/.

Another requirement is the CppADutils R package.  CppADutils is not licensed for public use or redistribution, but it can nevertheless be downloaded from www.github.com/braunm/CppADutils.

CppADutils assumes that CppAD is installed in the /opt/cppad
directory.  If CppAD is installed in another directory, the
src/Makevars files in CppADutils will have to be changed before
installing it.

The BD2015 package must be compiled from the source code; there are no pre-compiled binaries available.
